# MontyHall

**Project assumes background knowledge of the Monty Hall Problem.**

This project is a statistical analysis of the results of using two different strategies in the Monty Hall Problem.

The first strategy is to switch doors when offered the opportunity, the second is to keep the initial door choice.

There are three files comprising the project.

montyhall_switching.py is a python script that simulates a user-inputted number of Monty Hall games, in which the strategy is to always switch doors.
montyhall_staying.py is the same except the strategy is to always keep the initial door choice.

Finally, the notebook shows visualized results of 10000 simulations of each strategy.
